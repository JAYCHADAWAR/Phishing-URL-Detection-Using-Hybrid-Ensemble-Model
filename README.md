# Phishing-URL-Detection-Using-Hybrid-Ensemble-Model

The main goal of this project is to employ machine learning techniques to detect dangerous URLs and alert users to the possible risk of any phishing attempts that may be there. Phishing URLs can be classified as authentic or malicious using a variety of approaches. One way is to ban the URL and update it whenever a new dangerous URL is discovered.
